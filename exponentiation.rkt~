; Exponentiation

; Recursive proceedure to compute exponential of a given
; number b with the base n.

; We can say, b^n = b * b^(n-1), with b^0 = 1 as the base case.
; This can be converted to the following function
(define expt (Î»(b n) 
  (if (= n 0)
      1
      (* b (expt b (- n 1))))))
; (expt 2 3) => 8
